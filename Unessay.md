## Designing an experience of poetry and the self

I chose Cairo, Egypt as the topic for my potential historical engagement of my Unessay. As a disclaimer, I realize this work is not anywhere near the depth and breadth that was asked for. Gave it my best attempt all the things considered.

In Perry’s paper she argues for engagement using the power of emotions. Perry presents contentions, as we move forward with archeological engagement. To be enchanting, to dismiss finitude and cynicism around archeology and moving away from threat, towards expanding imagination. Emotions move people to act. “We can explore instances of feeling in culture and heritage experiences”. historical events reveal experience that may move you to cry and experience that move you to laugh. It’s tempting to lament and focus on what is tragic or to even tell a story dismissing some of the harsh tragedies. Reflecting on Bennet’s encouragement to engage in joy and play, I think designing an experience that highlights positive emotional engagement requires the contrast of the tragedy told with gentleness and sincerity. Further in the article Perry describes different feedback around the EMOTIVE project. Interesting to see both encouraging and discouraging sentiments around participating in meaningful and deep engagement. Individuals will have different comfort levels with engaging in vulnerable dialogue. In trying to improve upon this, designing an experience that “meets people where they are at”. In that there are different levels of comfort with different emotive experiences.  As well, to include in the story historical engagement, with joy but also with sadness and frustration.

Building on this with Kavanagh’s idea of fiction as history. I’d like to explore the interplay of poetic fiction and historical photos evoking emotion. Kavanagh discusses how Archeology can reanimate objects to make the invisible world visible. He goes on to elaborate on poetry’s place in history. I see his arguments building bridges where Perry was describing canyons of cynicism in history and lack of imagination in creating engagement. Kavanagh articulates that poetry focuses on process and product. Gives information about phenomenological practise. “All is potential content, the landscape in particular, in which we poets wander, wondering”. In observing events happening around me, I wanted to translate some of the experiences to my friends back in Canada. Some of the cultural history can’t be captured by a photo or poem alone. Especially because Cairo is complex, fast paced, and nuanced. Starting from storytelling and playfulness of engaging with history, the poetry I’ve recorded is attempting to create some of the wonderment I noticed around me. Wonder traces back to Perry’s text. The poetic mining, he engages with is especially appealing to relating intuitively to an experience and choosing to tell a story empathic to the essence of the space.  

In documenting to create engaging data to be fed into computation, I attempted to employ the method of, “free-form thematic interpretation/researcher voice that is self-reflexive”. The poems attempt to engage with the experience of uncovering history rather than the history itself.  For example:

The city of iron

Was in my pocket

Before I arrived

A steel nickel,

I brought to kin

Reject for being money

That’s a sin

The city where my grandmother lives is called steel and iron city. It use to be where families that manufactured products made of those materials use to live. Throughout my stay, I tried to understand engaging with the space and the meaningful playful engagement of this course. I gave a nickel to a family member to say this is where I ended up and this nickel comes from where I came from. Here I tried to emanate what Kavanagh is doing with his poetry to create narrative that is engaging. Using the technique’s, he describes by Prendergast’s form.

The same way a lack of knowledge is revealed in the ‘’tight form’’, writing revealed a lack of knowledge. I realized I didn’t know enough about the meaning of money or materials around me through writing this poem. The experience of documentation similarly revels assumptions and gaps of understanding. Making it easy to know what questions to ask and where. Even limitations of knowledge or where knowledge is located can be revealed through these methods. Not everyone had the facts of history in the place where history exist and sometimes a different story is told across the span of people about a singular event.  

## HPS framework

To answer some questions that McCall’s Framework addresses, before thinking of how to design the game I reflected on the following. What kinds of historical message does the game’s function promote? Tragedy and the circumstance of life in Egypt is deep and in high frequency. Simultaneously, it is beautiful and full of joyful resilience and coexistence with the facts of history and life. If anything, it is the reason enjoying time with others and celebrating what is good in life, so expressed. In using the framework to map game elements I take the answer to this question in consideration.

Name of game : La/ Nam means No/Yes

In the game I’d like to design I’d like to recreate the danger and playfulness that simultaneously exist in Egypt.

The game will require you to solve riddles and understand when the situation is safe or dangerous to engage with. This is reflective of what taking transportation in Egypt looks like. (Somehow upon reflection this comes full circle to my initial idea of wanting to riff off of Grand Theft Auto.) For example, you need to learn that you shouldn’t travel alone and what times are safe to travel in and what times are not. It is not always clear why you shouldn’t except a ride from a taxi or bus so the agent will be invited to solve a riddle.  

The goal will be to travel too as many places as possible in a set amount of time, to collect photos to complete the map of Egypt. As you learn how to travel farther, quicker; more of the map is revealed.

Taking into consideration McCall’s framework of strategizing the game world there will be an added level of who is accompanying you on the journey. This is reflective of some truth about Egypt. If you choose to travel alone, you may travel sooner and faster, but the risks are higher so sometimes, you will make all the right moves and still not make it to your destination. Conversely, whether you travel with a man or woman, younger or older, can effect how quickly you travel. How much distance you can cover. This designed element lets the agent strategize based on the places they haven’t covered in the map whether they need to travel with an elder aunt or a cousin. Whether they need to travel by taxi, or a mobile vehicle called Tuktuk.

Resources: knowledge and experienced gained, choice of social network.

Tools : Bus, taxi, personal driver, Tuktuk.

It may seem like a personal driver is always the good choice. Yet there are some places he won’t take you because he believes it is unsafe. So, it’s up to you to learn to navigate how different people in your network describe what is safe and not safe and understand navigating based on that. If you are too cautious, you may not find certain places if you are too risky you may lose resources. Or start over, or worse. Wait.

### Gameworld.

Throughout the game negotiating with family can be challenging and add cognitive load if the player chooses to avoid this and tries to fill the map without this engagement there is an effect. It will limit the places to be found. The map of places to explore expands as the player decides to meet the challenge of engaging with family. This is a strategically designed element of the Gameworld to reflect that engaging with family is not so black and white. It is another map onto itself that needs to be navigated but the rewards will be unexpected. New places on the map become revealed and the potential to explore expands. This is an attempt to represent the cultural geography. In this way the explicit game space is the map of places you observe that you are trying to uncover. Where the implicit game space is the cultural network, you try to learn and navigate between so you can succeed in navigating the map and expanding the space to discover.

The message of the game is to say sometimes you may need to go slow and strategize different ways to reach goals. Not every destination requires the same kind of problem solving. Sometimes, travelling slowly assures you that you will travel at all. Making sacrifices can reveal unexpected rewards and expand horizons.
